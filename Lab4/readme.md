# Lab 4: Inheritance, Polymorphism
This lab will cover the following topics:

* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* More JUnit features

## Inheritance and polymorphism
Real world concepts and structures often exhibit hierarchical arrangements, e.g. corporate structures, animal species, types of transportation, etc. Inheritance is used to achieve polymorphism and reduce redundant code when implementing such concepts.  

A class derived from another is called a subclass, and the class from which a subclass is derived from is called a superclass. The subclass inherits instance variables and methods except the constructor. An important concept of polymorphism is that an object of a subtype can be used wherever a supertype object is expected.

The `instanceof` operator is useful for determining the type of an object.
```
class Animal { }  
class Human extends Animal { } 
class Student extends Human { } 
```
Given the above definitions:
```
Animal a = new Animal();
Human h = new Human();
Student s = new Student();

System.out.println(a instanceof Animal); //true
System.out.println(a instanceof Human); //false
System.out.println(a instanceof Student); //false

System.out.println(h instanceof Animal); //true
System.out.println(h instanceof Human); //true
System.out.println(h instanceof Student); //false

System.out.println(s instanceof Animal); //true
System.out.println(s instanceof Human); //true
System.out.println(s instanceof Student); //true
```

## Notes on superclass constructors
Superclass constructors are not inherited. They can be invoked either implicitly or explicitly (using the `super` keyword). If explicit, the call to `super()` must be the first line in the subclass constructor. If implicit, it will call the no-args constructor. Make sure you supply one no-args constructor when the superclass has a constructor with arguments!
```
public class A{
    public A(int a){}
	//no default constructor given by Java, since we provided a constructor
}
class B extends A {
	public B(int a){
	    //Implicitly calling superclass constructor
	    //Java TRIES to add "super()" here, but fails, since only super(int) exists!
	} 
}
public class C {
	public static void main (String[] args){
		B obj = new B(1);
	}
}
```

## Notes on overriding, overloading, and inheriting superclass methods
A subclass overrides a superclass method when the method signature is the same, and the access rights not more restrictive than original. An example of a commonly overridden method is `toString()`, which returns the string representation of some user-defined type. It's good practice to use the `@Override` annotation, which lets Java check if you really did override something.
```
public class A {  
    protected void func(){}
    protected void func2(){}
    protected void func3(){}
    protected void func4(){}
}
public class B extends A {
    protected void func(){}  //overriding, since protected == protected
    public void func2(){}  //overriding, since public is less restrictive than protected
    private void func3(){}   //compile error! private is MORE restrictive than protected
    void func4(){}  //compile error! default is MORE restrictive than protected
    
    // private < default < protected < public
}
``` 
Private functions cannot be overridden. Static methods also cannot be overriden, but instead can be "hidden" behind a function with the same signature.

|                | Overridable? | Inherited? |
|----------------|--------------|------------|
| Private method | No           | No         |
| Static method  | No           | Yes        |

```
class Test {
    public static void func(){}
}

class Main extends Test {
    public void func(){}; //error, cannot override
}
```
```
public class A{
	public static void haha() {}
}

public class B extends A {
	public static void haha(){} //compiles! A.haha hidden behind B.haha
}

public class C {
	public static void main (String[] args){
		B.haha(); //OK
		B.A.haha(); //ERROR
	}
}
```

Don't confuse overloading with overriding. Overriding refers to having the same signature (same name and parameters). Java performs dynamic binding at runtime to determine the correct version of the method to call (i.e. to choose the subclass version, not the superclass version). Overloading refers to having the same name (but possibly different return types/parameters). The correct version of the method to use is determined at compile time.

## JUnit features
* `@DisplayName`, for the test runners/reports to show custom names instead of the method name
```
@Test
@DisplayName("Custom test name containing spaces")
void testWithDisplayNameContainingSpaces() {}
```
* `@Disabled`, for temporarily skipping a test while you're debugging
```
@Disabled
@Test
void testWillBeSkipped() {}
```

## What you need to do
Implement the following classes according to the diagram.  
![diagram.png](diagram.png)  
Note: this was actually generated automatically by Intellij. You can create it by right clicking the class/project of interest, `Diagrams > Show Diagrams`. The green open lock indicates public, and the red lock indicates private. You may implement the `toString()` method however you like, as long as it includes the class name somewhere inside the string (case-sensitive). Then, test your code with the provided JUnit test cases, by right clicking the project and clicking `run all tests`.
